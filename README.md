# maze-solver

•	Used k-d tree, stack, queues, graph to construct the structure of Maze and implement searching and sorting algoriths  
•	Applied BFS and DFS algorithms to solve every case for maze efficiently  •	Utilized Gdb to debug and test the function of software  
•	Optimized the running time by implementing several advanced BFS, and DFS algorithms
